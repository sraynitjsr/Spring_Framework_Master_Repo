## Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for object-relational mapping (ORM).

## It allows us to define and manage the relationships between Java objects and relational database tables.

## JPA provides a set of annotations that we can use to configure and map Java classes to database tables.

## These annotations are typically used in Java entities, which are Java classes representing database tables.
