### In Java, annotations are a form of metadata that provide information about various elements of your code.
### They are introduced by the @ symbol and are placed directly before classes, methods, fields, or other program elements.
### Annotations do not change the behavior of the code but provide information that can be used by tools or frameworks like Spring to configure and enhance the application.
