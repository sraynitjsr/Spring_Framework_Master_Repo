### In Java, annotations are a form of metadata that provide information about various elements of your code.
### They are introduced by the @ symbol and are placed directly before classes, methods, fields, or other program elements.
### Annotations do not change the behavior of the code but provide information that can be used by tools or frameworks like Spring to configure and enhance the application.

### Spring Annotations

##### Spring Framework extensively uses annotations to simplify configuration and development.

#### Here are some commonly used Spring annotations :-

###### @Component: Marks a Java class as a Spring bean, allowing Spring to manage its lifecycle and dependencies.

###### @Autowired: Injects dependencies automatically, reducing the need for manual wiring of components.

###### @Controller, @Service, and @Repository: Specialized versions of @Component to indicate the roles of specific classes in your application.

###### @Configuration: Marks a class as a configuration class, defining Spring bean definitions and configuration settings.

###### @Bean: Used within configuration classes to define Spring beans explicitly.

###### @RequestMapping: Used in Spring MVC to map HTTP requests to specific controller methods.

###### @Value: Injects values from properties files or other sources into Spring beans.

###### @Qualifier: Used with @Autowired to specify which bean to inject if multiple candidates exist.


### How Annotations Benefit Spring Development :-

#### Reduced XML Configuration: Annotations reduce the need for XML configuration in Spring applications, making the code more concise and easier to read.

#### Improved Development Speed: They make it easier to define beans, wire dependencies, and configure aspects, resulting in faster development.

#### Better Code Organization: Annotations help to clarify the roles of classes and methods within your application.
