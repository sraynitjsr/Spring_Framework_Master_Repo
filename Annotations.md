### In Java, annotations are a form of metadata that provide information about various elements of your code.
### They are introduced by the @ symbol and are placed directly before classes, methods, fields, or other program elements.
### Annotations do not change the behavior of the code but provide information that can be used by tools or frameworks like Spring to configure and enhance the application.

### Spring Annotations

##### Spring Framework extensively uses annotations to simplify configuration and development.

##### Here are some commonly used Spring annotations :-
###### @Component: Marks a Java class as a Spring bean, allowing Spring to manage its lifecycle and dependencies.
###### @Autowired: Injects dependencies automatically, reducing the need for manual wiring of components.
###### @Controller, @Service, and @Repository: Specialized versions of @Component to indicate the roles of specific classes in your application.
